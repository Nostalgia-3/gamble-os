# Gamble OS

GaOS is the supreme 32-bit operating system (technically kernel).

## Building

GaOS needs at least GCC v12.2.0, ld v2.40, nasm v2.16.01, and deno v2.1.3. Once you have those installed, run `deno -A make.ts`, which creates `build/os.bin`

## Todo 

- [ ] Arrow keys to cycle throught past commands
- [ ] Arrow keys to cycle between letters in the command bar
- [ ] Real time clock read
- [ ] Real time clock write
